The Artistic License 2.0

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
Package available as open source and free software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
a different licensing arrangement.

Definitions

    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.

    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
    procedures.

    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
    distribute, or modify the Package.

    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
    Version, or a Modified Version.

    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.

    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
    by the Copyright Holder.

    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
    Holder.

    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
    configuration files for the Package.

    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
    translation of the Source form.


Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
you do not Distribute the Modified Version.


Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
Compiled form of the Package.

(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
will be subject to the Original License.


Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
you do at least ONE of the following:

    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
    Version.

    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
    from the name of the Standard Version.

    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
    under

        (i)  the Original License or

        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
        Fees are allowed.


Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
or Modified Versions without the Source

(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
the Source of the Modified Version.


Aggregating or Linking the Package

(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
as included in the aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.


Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
terms of this license.


General Provisions

(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
license.

(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
this license.

(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
date that such litigation is filed.

(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

                    ----------------------------

                            2006-Jan-27

                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg



Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """
    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source

      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use

[GPL v2]

""CLASSPATH"" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL

Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
the words ""Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the ""Classpath""
exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.""

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

OPENJDK ASSEMBLY EXCEPTION

The OpenJDK source code made available by Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) at
openjdk.java.net ("OpenJDK Code") is distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html> version 2
only ("GPL2"), with the following clarification and special exception.

    Linking this OpenJDK Code statically or dynamically with other code
    is making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms
    and conditions of GPL2 cover the whole combination.

    As a special exception, Oracle gives you permission to link this
    OpenJDK Code with certain code licensed by Oracle as indicated at
    http://openjdk.java.net/legal/exception-modules-2007-05-08.html
    ("Designated Exception Modules") to produce an executable,
    regardless of the license terms of the Designated Exception Modules,
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under GPL2,
    provided that the Designated Exception Modules continue to be
    governed by the licenses under which they were offered by Oracle.

As such, it allows licensees and sublicensees of Oracle's GPL2 OpenJDK Code
to build an executable that includes those portions of necessary code that
Oracle could not provide under GPL2 (or that Oracle has provided under GPL2
with the Classpath exception).  If you modify or add to the OpenJDK code,
that new GPL2 code may still be combined with Designated Exception Modules
if the new code is made subject to this exception by its copyright holder.

The GNU General Public License (GPL)

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
"you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
    this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
    not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
    Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
    more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
    type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

    Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
License instead of this License.

5.6	Licence to Free Edition Software, Core Edition Software and Freeware. In return for the mutual rights and obligations set out in this Agreement, we grant you the right to use the Freeware, Core Edition Software and Free Edition Software.

5.8	For the avoidance of doubt: (a) clauses 3, 6, 8.1 and 8.4 of this Agreement shall not apply to the Free Edition Software, Core Edition Software, Freeware and Preview Software; and (b) clause 13.2 shall apply except that the wording "and in such event, we shall refund to you all Licence Fees paid" shall be deleted and replaced with ", but no financial reimbursement will be given to you in such circumstances."

5.11.1	the rights granted under clause 5 to use the Licensed Software shall continue only for the applicable licence period specified in Schedule 9 ("Free Licence Period").
5.11.2	Schedules 1-7 (inclusive) and 10 do not apply.
5.11.3	if at any time you obtain a paid up licence of SQL Prompt Pro or ReadyRoll Pro, your use of SQL Prompt Pro or ReadyRoll Pro (as applicable) will be governed by this Agreement, except that clauses 5.6, 5.8 and 5.11 will no longer apply.
5.12	SQL Clone. Where the Licensed Software is SQL Clone, the terms set out in Schedule 10 shall apply in relation to such Licensed Software in addition to the licence in clause 5.

6.2	Licence Fees shall be payable on installation of the Licensed Software and/or on purchase and/or renewal of a Support Package (as applicable), except where agreed otherwise in writing with us.
6.3	Licence Fees for certain of the Licensed Software may differ depending on your status, and our website will identify where this is relevant. In relation to such Licensed Software, you must let us know if your status changes and we will be entitled to invoice for additional Licence Fees if appropriate. Failure to inform us of a change of status is a breach of your Licence and this Agreement.
6.4	Where you have obtained the Licensed Software through a Reseller, the terms you have agreed with such Reseller in relation to payment and invoicing will apply instead of this clause 6 (and Schedule 6).

7	CONFIDENTIALITY 
7.1	The structure, organisation, and source code of the Licensed Software are valuable trade secrets and proprietary confidential information of ours and our licensors. You agree not to provide or disclose any confidential information in the Licensed Software or derived from it to any third party, including where such confidential information is derived under any applicable law as set out in clause 5.2 (except in, and limited to, the circumstances permitted under Schedule 3). 
7.2	Other than the disclosures referred to in our Privacy Policy (see clause 12), we agree not to provide or disclose any information of a confidential nature in any form whatsoever which is disclosed by or on behalf of you to us to any third party.
7.3	The provisions of clauses 7.1 and 7.2 will not apply to the extent that: 
7.3.1	such information is in the receiving party’s possession free from any restriction as to its use or disclosure; or
7.3.2	the receiving part can demonstrate that such information is in the public domain (other than as a result of an unauthorised disclosure); or
7.3.3	such information is required to be disclosed by law. 
7.4	No information to which clause 7.3.3 applies shall be disclosed to a third party unless and until the receiving party has (unless prevented from doing so by law): 
7.4.1	given the disclosing party, where practicable, five (5) U.K. business days, written notice of such proposed disclosure; 
7.4.2	consulted with the disclosing party; and
7.4.3	agreed with the disclosing party the content of the disclosure
provided that it shall not limit the disclosure in a manner which would prevent the receiving party from complying with a statutory or regulatory obligation or court order. 
7.5	For the purpose of this clause 7, “receiving party” means the party receiving the confidential information and “disclosing party” means the party by whom confidential information is disclosed.

8	WARRANTY AND SUPPORT
8.1	We hereby warrant that: 
8.1.1	we own the Intellectual Property Rights in the Software and/or have the right to grant a licence to you;
8.1.2	in creating the Licensed Software, we have not knowingly infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties; and
8.1.3	the Licensed Software shall operate substantially in accordance with its description. However, you acknowledge that the Licensed Software and related materials is of such a complexity that there will be inherent defects and that therefore we can give no warranty that the Licensed Software is free from error or defect or that operation of the Licensed Software shall be uninterrupted.
8.2	Other than as provided for in clause 8.1 above, we do not offer any warranty related to the Licensed Software and/or the Support Package, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of fitness for purpose or satisfactory quality. The Licensed Software has been developed as a standard product for use by a wide variety of users and so we are unable to warrant that the Licensed Software will meet any particular user needs. You shall take full responsibility for ensuring that the Licensed Software is suitable for your intended purposes and to facilitate your checks of such suitability, we offer a free Evaluation Period. 
8.3	In relation to the Free Edition Software, Core Edition Software, Preview Software and Freeware, you hereby agree that the Licensed Software is provided "AS IS" with no representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind as to its functionality, quality, performance, suitability or fitness for purpose. All other terms, conditions, representations and warranties expressed or implied whether by statute or otherwise are hereby expressly excluded. 
8.4	Support. In relation to and without prejudice to the generality of clause 8.2 above, we provide support to users via our web site and user forums. You may also purchase a Support Package with certain of the Licensed Software, and when purchased, provision of the Support Package shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement. You accept that, although we will use reasonable endeavours to solve problems identified by purchasers of the Support Package, the nature of software is such that no guarantee can be provided that any particular problem will be solved. We shall have the right to withdraw services under the Support Package, without notice, if you are in default under any terms of this Agreement.

9	LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY 
9.1	We do not exclude our liability (if any) to you: 
9.1.1	for personal injury or death resulting from our negligence;
9.1.2	for fraud; or
9.1.3	for any other matter for which liability cannot be excluded by law. 
9.2	Subject to clause 9.1, we shall not be liable to you for any of the following types of loss or damage arising under or in relation to this Agreement (whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, restitution or otherwise):
9.2.1	any loss of profits, business, contracts, anticipated savings, goodwill, or revenue; or
9.2.2	any loss, or corruption, of software or data; or
9.2.3	any loss of use of hardware, software or data; or
9.2.4	any indirect, special or consequential loss or damage whatsoever,
even if we have been advised in advance of the possibility of such loss or damage. 
9.3	Subject to clauses 9.1 and 9.2, our aggregate liability under this Agreement (whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, restitution or otherwise) shall be limited in all cases to the price paid for the Licensed Software. In relation to the Free Edition Software, Core Edition Software, Preview Software and Freeware, our sole liability under this Agreement, subject to clause 9.1, shall be as set out in clause 13.2 as amended by clause 5.8.
9.4	You acknowledge that the provisions of clauses 8, 9 and 13.1 are reasonable and reflected in the price which would be higher without those provisions, and you will accept such risk. In the event that any of the limitations or exemptions in this Agreement shall be found to be void, clauses 8, 9 and 13.1 shall be construed in accordance with clause 16. 

10	TERM AND TERMINATION 
10.1	The Licence shall commence upon your acceptance of its terms and shall continue in perpetuity unless terminated in accordance with clause 10.3 or 10.4, or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement. 
10.2	Any Support Package you purchase will be provided for the Term, unless terminated in accordance with clause 10.3 or 10.4, or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement. 
10.3	We may terminate the Licence and/or Support Package immediately and without notice if:
10.3.1	we reasonably suspect that you are using the Licensed Software for any purpose which contravenes the laws of England; or
10.3.2	you materially fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement.
10.4	The Licence will terminate automatically:
	10.4.1	if you uninstall the Licensed Software, or uninstall and destroy or voluntarily return the Licensed Software to us; or
	10.4.2	at the end of the Free Licence Period.
10.5	Where the Licence is terminated in accordance with clause 10.3 or 10.4, then the Agreement shall terminate in its entirety.
10.6	Upon termination of this Agreement, you must uninstall the Licensed Software and destroy all copies of the Licensed Software including all components of it in your power, possession or control. 
10.7	The termination of this Agreement howsoever arising shall not affect the rights, duties and liabilities of either party accrued prior to termination. Following termination, no obligations or liabilities remain with us. 
10.8	On termination of this Agreement, and except as under clause 10.5 above, the provisions of clause 1 (Definitions), 2 (Interpretation), 4 (Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights), clause 7 (Confidentiality), clauses 8.2 and 8.3 (Warranty), clause 9 (Limitation and Exclusion of Liability), clause 10 (Term and Termination), clause 11 (Audit), clause 13 (Third Party Claims), clauses 14 to 21 and paragraph 3 of Schedule 3, will remain in effect. 

11	AUDIT
11.1	You agree that we shall have the right (where we reasonably suspect that the terms of clauses 5 and 6 have not been complied with or that you are otherwise in breach of this Agreement) upon reasonable notice to have an independent third party auditor enter your premises to audit any OSE system or electronic media onto which the Licensed Software or any adaptation, modification or copy of the Licensed Software has been installed in order to verify compliance with this Agreement. Prior to exercising such right to audit we and/or the third party auditor shall if required by you enter into an appropriate and reasonable confidentiality agreement. We will pay the costs of any such examination or audit unless such audit shows that additional fees are payable by you or that you are otherwise in breach of this Agreement, in which case you shall pay the costs of the examination or audit. 
11.2	Where we reasonably conclude that additional Licence Fees are due from you under this Agreement, we shall make a request in writing. You shall pay such additional Licence Fees within thirty (30) days of the date of the request. Non payment of such fees shall, without prejudice to any other rights that we might have, give us the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. 
11.3	Where we reasonably conclude that you are otherwise in breach of this Agreement, we shall at our sole choice provide you with written notice of such breach and either (i) provide details of any remedial action required by you; or (ii) terminate this Agreement. 
11.4	Where the SQL Comparison SDK is licensed to you, we shall also have the right to audit through independent certified public accountants all records and accounts of yours which contain information bearing upon the amount of Licensed Products licensed, sold or distributed by you. We shall ensure that such independent accountants are bound by confidentiality undertakings at least as onerous as those set out in clause 7. To the extent an examination and audit reveals more than 10 copies of Licensed Products incorporating Licensed Materials having been made, distributed, sold or licensed without the applicable licence fees having been paid, an appropriate payment shall be made promptly to us by you to reflect an amount of royalties agreed by the parties in relation to such Licensed Products, otherwise we may terminate this Agreement in accordance with clause 10.2. 

12	DATA COLLECTION AND PRIVACY POLICY
	Information on the data we collect about you and how we treat that data is set out in our Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at: https://www.red-gate.com/our-company/about/legal.

13	THIRD PARTY CLAIMS
13.1	Except as in clause 13.2 below, if a third party claims that the Licensed Software, as a result of your use of the Licensed Software, causes loss or damage whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, restitution or otherwise, then, without prejudice to our overall liability to such third party, you shall indemnify us from any such loss or damage. 
13.2	If any claim is brought against you alleging that your use of the intellectual property associated with the Licensed Software infringes the rights of any third party, you shall promptly notify us and supply full details of the claim. The two of us shall consult together on an appropriate course of action and shall seek to minimise the effect of any claim on the respective businesses. We shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take control of all negotiations and litigation arising out of the claim. We will pay any damages and costs awarded against you in connection with any claim subject to a maximum of the aggregate sum of Licence Fees paid to us by you under this Agreement. We shall have the right, at our sole choice, either: (i) use reasonable endeavours to negotiate terms for continued use by you of the claimed infringing software; or (ii) use reasonable endeavours to amend the Licensed Software to make it non-infringing; or (iii) terminate this Agreement with immediate effect and in such event, we shall refund to you all Licence Fees paid. 

14	GOVERNING LAW AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
14.1	This Agreement (and any dispute or claim relating to it, or its formation, existence, construction, performance, validity or termination) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. 
14.2	The courts of England and Wales shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).
14.3	Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that we may have, you acknowledge and agree that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of clauses 4, 5 and/or 7 by you. Accordingly, we shall be entitled to seek an injunction or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of those clauses.

15	COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW
You acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding the fact that this Agreement is governed by the laws of England you may be subject to additional laws in other jurisdictions with respect to your use of the Licensed Software in such jurisdictions. You agree to comply with the laws of any such jurisdiction that apply to the Licensed Software including without limitation any applicable export laws or regulations. 

16	SEVERABILITY
If any provision or part of any provision in this Agreement shall be found by any court, body or authority of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason then the parties shall meet promptly to discuss in good faith and agree an alternative provision or part provision that provides as closely as possible, the same commercial effect as the original. If this happens then the remaining provisions or part provisions are unaffected. 

17	NO WAIVER
No failure or delay by any party to exercise any right, power or remedy will operate as a waiver of it nor will any partial exercise preclude any further exercise of the same, or of some other right, power or remedy. 

18	NO THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
We and you do not intend that any of this Agreement will be enforceable by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 by any person not a party to it and all rights by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 are hereby excluded. 

19	ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement contains all the terms which the parties have agreed in relation to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes any prior written or oral agreements, representations (save for any fraudulent misrepresentation, fraud or concealment) or understandings between the parties in relation to such subject matter. 

20	REVISIONS TO TERMS
We reserve the right to revise the terms of this Agreement by updating this Agreement on our website, or by notifying you by post or by email. You are advised to check the website periodically for notices concerning such revisions. Your continued use of the Licensed Software shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of any revised terms. 

21	NO ASSIGNMENT
21.1	The Licence is personal to you. You may not assign the benefit or delegate the burden of this Agreement or hold this Agreement on trust for any other person, provided that: 
21.1.1	You shall, in relation to Per OSE Licensed Software, be entitled to assign or transfer the benefit of this Agreement once to another single OSE owned, leased and/or controlled by you or your employer or organisation for whom you have installed the Licensed Software for internal use. Any second or subsequent assignment or transfer of the benefit of this Agreement of Per OSE Licensed Software shall require our prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld; and
21.1.2	where the Licensed Software is Per OSE Licensed Software which includes a Client Component, you may use and install such Client Component on more than one OSE.  

22	CONSUMER REGULATIONS
22.1	This clause applies to Consumers only.
22.2	You shall have the right to cancel this Agreement 14 days from the date you agree to be obliged to pay for the Licensed Software and/or Support Package under this Agreement.

22.3.1	returning a completed Model Cancellation Form (a copy of which is available here: https://www.red-gate.com/our-company/about/legal to us; or
22.3.2		sending us an email clearly confirming your decision to the relevant email address on the "Contact Us" page of our website.

SUPPORT PACKAGE

We provide support and upgrade services for specific Licensed Software products. An outline of the Support Package is given below and further details may be available from our website. Subject to payment of the relevant fee for the Support Package, the following shall apply: 

1	The Support Package is purchased on an annual, non refundable, basis in advance except for Software provided on a subscription basis where the fees for the Support Package are included in the relevant subscription fee. 
2	We shall supply upgrades to the Licensed Software as they are released. 
3	We shall respond to email support requests from you within a reasonable period, normally one business day. Where we consider it necessary to facilitate efficient communication, we may contact you by telephone or otherwise. 
4	We shall use reasonable endeavours to solve problems identified by you. Given the nature of software, it is not possible for us to warrant that we will be able to solve any particular problem in a given timescale, or at all. However, we undertake to keep you updated on progress and, where practical, provide an interim fix and/or workaround so that you can continue effective use of the Licensed Software. 
5	You accept that, where a particular identified problem requires an update to the Licensed Software, the scheduling of any new releases and the functionality those releases contain shall be under our sole control.

SCHEDULE 6
HANDLING OF TAXES

For the purposes of this Schedule, “Withholding Tax” means any tax deducted at source for payments (typically interest, dividend or royalties) to a foreign corporation, as determined by the payer’s domestic tax legislation. 

Payment of Licence Fees shall not be reduced on account of any taxes unless required by any applicable laws. We shall be responsible for paying any and all taxes (other than Withholding Taxes required by any applicable law to be paid by you) levied on account of, or measured in whole or in part by reference to, any payments we receive. You shall deduct or withhold from payment of the Licence Fees any taxes that you are required by applicable law to deduct or withhold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are entitled under any applicable tax treaty or convention to a reduction of rate of, or the elimination of, applicable Withholding Tax, we may deliver to you or the appropriate governmental authority (with your assistance to the extent that this is reasonably required) the prescribed forms necessary to reduce the applicable rate of withholding or to relieve you of your obligation to withhold tax. You shall render all reasonable assistance to us for this purpose as is requested by us (such assistance to include the signing by you or any of your officers of any required forms or other document so required). You shall apply the reduced rate of withholding, or dispense with withholding, as the case may be, provided that you have received evidence, in a form satisfactory to you, of our delivery of all applicable forms (and, if necessary, the receipt of appropriate governmental authorisation) at least 7 (seven) days prior to the time that the payments to us are due. If, in accordance with the foregoing, you withhold any amount from a payment to us ("Withholding"), you shall (subject to the provisions of this clause) pay to us the payment net of the Withholding when due, and shall account to the proper tax authority for the Withholding. You shall send to us proof of such Withholding and that such Withholding has been accounted to the proper tax authority (through a self-declaration issued by you) within 30 (thirty) days following payment of the Withholding to the tax authority and shall, if requested by us, provide to us a copy of any return made to a tax authority of the Withholding within 10 days of request (or, if later, within 10 days of such return being made to the relevant tax authority). We shall have the right, if permissible under applicable laws, to require you to delay payment of Licence Fees in order to enable us to benefit from any applicable double taxation or other taxation treaties or conventions. You shall indemnify, keep indemnified and hold harmless, us against all losses incurred or suffered by us arising out of your failure to duly and timely pay any tax to the applicable tax Authorities or other authorities within the relevant period in accordance with this clause.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *

************************************************************************

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove

For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

2. Grant of Copyright License.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        directory, recursing into subdirectories to find them and return all
        tests found within them. Only test files that match the pattern will
        be loaded. (Using shell style pattern matching.)

        All test modules must be importable from the top level of the project.
        If the start directory is not the top level directory then the top
        level directory must be specified separately.

        If a test package name (directory with '__init__.py') matches the
        pattern then the package will be checked for a 'load_tests' function. If
        this exists then it will be called with (loader, tests, pattern) unless
        the package has already had load_tests called from the same discovery
        invocation, in which case the package module object is not scanned for
        tests - this ensures that when a package uses discover to further
        discover child tests that infinite recursion does not happen.

        If load_tests exists then discovery does *not* recurse into the package,
        load_tests is responsible for loading all tests in the package.

        The pattern is deliberately not stored as a loader attribute so that
        packages can continue discovery themselves. top_level_dir is stored so
        load_tests does not need to pass this argument in to loader.discover().

        Paths are sorted before being imported to ensure reproducible execution
        order even on filesystems with non-alphabetical ordering like ext3/4.

        directory, recursing into subdirectories to find them and return all
        tests found within them. Only test files that match the pattern will
        be loaded. (Using shell style pattern matching.)

        All test modules must be importable from the top level of the project.
        If the start directory is not the top level directory then the top
        level directory must be specified separately.

        If a test package name (directory with '__init__.py') matches the
        pattern then the package will be checked for a 'load_tests' function. If
        this exists then it will be called with (loader, tests, pattern) unless
        the package has already had load_tests called from the same discovery
        invocation, in which case the package module object is not scanned for
        tests - this ensures that when a package uses discover to further
        discover child tests that infinite recursion does not happen.

        If load_tests exists then discovery does *not* recurse into the package,
        load_tests is responsible for loading all tests in the package.

        The pattern is deliberately not stored as a loader attribute so that
        packages can continue discovery themselves. top_level_dir is stored so
        load_tests does not need to pass this argument in to loader.discover().

        Paths are sorted before being imported to ensure reproducible execution
        order even on filesystems with non-alphabetical ordering like ext3/4.
